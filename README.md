# CancerLLM

###  Introdudction
In this work, we proposed CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture,
pre-trained on nearly 2.7M clinical notes and over 515K pathology reports covering
17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on two cancer-relevant tasks, including
cancer phenotypes extraction and cancer diagnosis generation
